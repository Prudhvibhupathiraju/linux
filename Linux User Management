Types of users in Linux
In Linux every user has User ID (UID).
The system uses this number to identify the users internally

Root User (UID = 0)
The root user is the superuser or administrator of the system
has full control and can do any thing in the system
Root can install or remove software, add or delete users, change system settings, modify any file(even other user's files), start/stop system services
root has no restrictions, a wrong command can damage the system, hence normal users use (sudo <command>) this gives temporary root pemissions 
Full control access (Yes)

System Users (UID 1 - 999)
These users are created automatically when you install linux or software
They are used by services and applications
services need permission to run securely
if service is hacked only service related user is affected not the entire system
Full control access (Limited)

Normal Users (UID 1000+)
These are normal users who login to the system
when you create a user the UID starts from 1000
normal users can access their own files run programs use installed applications
Full control access (No)

GID ( system groups < 1000, Normal groups >= 1000 ) 

UID range used to identify type of user, apply permissions, improve security and seperate services from humans

/etc/passwd - this file stores basic information about all users it does not store passwords, it contains username, UID, GID, Home directory, Default shell
prudhvi:x:1001:1001::/home/prudhvi:/bin/bash ( here x means password is stored in /etc/shadow) (passwords are moved to /etc/shadow for security reasons on new linux systems)
username : password_place_holder : UID : GID : coment : home directory : shell

/etc/shadow - this file stores actual encrypted passwords ( only root can read this file )
john:$6$randomhashvalue:19850:0:99999:7:::
username : encrypted password : password last changed : min days of password expiry : max days of password expiry : warning num of days : inactive(account disable after password expiry) : Expiry Date :
if account is locked you might see * or !
sample 
john:!$6$abc123hashvalue:19850:0:99999:7:::
john:*:19850:0:99999:7:::

/etc/group
This file defines groups in Linux groups are used to share file permissions, control access
developers:x:1002:john,raj
group name : password place holder : GID : group members

/etc/gshadow
this contains group passwords ( now a days group passwords are not used)
developers:!::
groupname:encrypted_password:group_admins:group_members

/etc/login.defs
this defines default values when creating users
ex : UID starting num, password aging rules

/etc/skel
when you create a new user linux copies files from /etc/skel to home directory of the user

Special permissions

SUID (Set User ID) - Value = 4
- Works on executable file(programs)

When user runs the program
the program runs with file owner's permissions, not the user's permissions
it temporarily borrows file owner's permissions

SGID (Set Group ID) - Value =2
it works differently for files and directories
on executable files (it runs with file group permissions)
on directory, any file created inside a directory will automatically inherit the directory's group
without SGID 
User1 creates file -> group = user 1's primary group
User2 creates file -> group = user 2's primary group

with SGID
drwxrwsr-x  project_dir
s in group position
chmod 2775 project_dir
2 -> SGID
775 -> normal permission

Sticky Bit - Value =1
Works on direxctories only
In a shared directory only the file owner can delete their file even if others have write permission
without sticky bit any file can be deleted by anybody
With sticky bit only file owner, directory owner and root can delete the file

ACL (Access control list)
if file permissions are needed to grant for specific user then ACL are needed
