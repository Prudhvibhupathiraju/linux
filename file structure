Understanding the Folder Structure
Explanation of System Directories
Symbolic Links (Less Significant)
Directory 	Description
/sbin -> /usr/sbin 	System binaries for administrative commands (linked to /usr/sbin).
/bin -> /usr/bin 	Essential user binaries (linked to /usr/bin).
/lib -> /usr/lib 	Shared libraries and kernel modules (linked to /usr/lib).
Important System Directories
Directory 	Description
/boot 	Stores files needed for booting the system (not relevant in containers).
/usr 	Contains most user-installed applications and libraries.
/var 	Stores logs, caches, and temporary files that change frequently.
/etc 	Stores system configuration files.
User & Application-Specific Directories
Directory 	Description
/home 	Default location for user home directories.
/opt 	Used for installing optional third-party software.
/srv 	Holds data for services like web servers (rarely used in containers).
/root 	Home directory for the root user.
Temporary & Volatile Directories
Directory 	Description
/tmp 	Temporary files (cleared on reboot).
/run 	Holds runtime data for processes.
/proc 	Virtual filesystem for process and system information.
/sys 	Virtual filesystem for hardware and kernel information.
/dev 	Contains device files (e.g., /dev/null, /dev/sda).
Mount Points
Directory 	Description
/mnt 	Temporary mount point for external filesystems.
/media 	Mount point for removable media (USB, CDs).

/data 	Likely your mounted volume from Windows (C:/ubuntu-data).


/sbin is a system binary directory — it contains essential system administration executables (programs and commands) that are usually used by the root (superuser).

/lib is a system directory that contains shared libraries — these are files that programs and the operating system need to run.

/bin stands for “binary”, and it contains essential user command binaries — the basic programs needed for the system to boot, repair itself, and allow users to work. These are commands that both normal users and root can run.

/boot holds the bootloader and kernel files that your system needs to start up. Without this directory, Linux cannot boot.
