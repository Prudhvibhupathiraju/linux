when we give command yum update -y
yum looks inside /etc/yum.repos.d/* for .rep files
in .repo file contains information of which servers to contact, whether they are enabled how to connect securely
yum connects to those servers and downloads metadata (Metadata means list of packages available, their versions, their dependencies and security info) 
this information is stored in /var/cache/dnf
It checks what is already installed in /var/lib/rpm (rpm is a database it contains package names installed versions and installation history)
now yum compares installed versions vs online versions
any new versions are marked for update
yum now downloads real update files .rpm files temporarily in /var/cache/dnf
Before installing dnf checks Digital signature(GPG key) and file integrity (if verification fails installation stops)
Now the installation starts RPM does stop related services(if required), removes old package files copies new files into system updates config files and runs install scripts
files may change in /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /etc, /var
/var/lib/rpm RPM database is updated 
if kernel is updated new files are stored in /boot reboot required to update the kernel version 

Boot process 
BIOS/UEFI runs
GRUB Loads Kernel and vmlinuz file (Grand Unified BootLoader) 

/boot has 
vmlinuz(Kernel File) This is a kernel file (core of the OS) When you update kernel new vmlinuz file is stored here
initramfs (Initial RAM Filesystem) is needed to load drivers, detect disks, Activate LVM/RAID and mounts root file system
GRUB bootloader files
during patching New kernel file is saved in /boot
GRUB configuration is updated 
old kernel is kept as backup
if /boot is full kernel update will fail

/etc (configuration files)
Some packages are update config files
if config break services may not start after patch

/var 
packages are downloaded into /var/cache/dnf
logs are written into /var/log
if /var is full update will fail

/usr 
when packages are updated old binaries are replaced and newer versions are installed 

/lib or /lib64
Many programs depend on shared libraries

/opt 
Third party apps depend on system libraries
