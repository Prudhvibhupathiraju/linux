when we give command yum update -y
yum looks inside /etc/yum.repos.d/* for .rep files
in .repo file contains information of which servers to contact, whether they are enabled how to connect securely
yum connects to those servers and downloads metadata (Metadata means list of packages available, their versions, their dependencies and security info) 
this information is stored in /var/cache/dnf
It checks what is already installed in /var/lib/rpm (rpm is a database it contains package names installed versions and installation history)
now yum compares installed versions vs online versions
any new versions are marked for update
yum now downloads real update files .rpm files temporarily in /var/cache/dnf
Before installing dnf checks Digital signature(GPG key) and file integrity (if verification fails installation stops)
Now the installation starts RPM does stop related services(if required), removes old package files copies new files into system updates config files and runs install scripts
files may change in /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /etc, /var
/var/lib/rpm RPM database is updated 
if kernel is updated new files are stored in /boot reboot required to update the kernel version
