if a kernel has a vulnerability whole system is at risk
Privilege Escalation
Normal user becomes root user (user runs special exploit and gets root access
Buffer overflow
Program writes too much data into memory. This allows attckers to run the malicious code
Outdated kernel bugs
Old kernel versions may have known security flaws

Kernel vulnerability fix : Keep the kernel updated, reboot after patch

Software Vulnerabilities 
These are vulnerabilities in software applications
Not kernel - But programs like   Appache, mysql Openssl etc
causes
Outdated packages
Old versions of packages may contain security flaws
Unpatched service
Third party applications - Software in /opt may not get updated
Fix - Regular patching

Network Vulnerabilities
Attackers scan internet for open ports
open ports
Weak firewall rules
Unsecured SSH

Misconfiguration Issues
File permission 777
SE Linux Disabled
