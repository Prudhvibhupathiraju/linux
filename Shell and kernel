User -> Shell -> Kernel -> hardware

A Shell is a program that lets you talk to the linux system
shell works as a middle layer for user and the kernel

you type a command shell understands it and sends it to the kernel 
kernel talks to the hardware and gives the result back


Kernel -> Kernel is the core of the operating system
It controls CPU, Memory, Disk, Devices and processes
you cannot talk directly to the kernel you need shell

Example
you type ls
shell reads the command
shell asks kernel to list files
kernel reads the disk
output comes back to you (all happens in seconds)

default in most linux systems (Bash) (bourne again shell) 

Types of shell
interactive shell
you type the commands manually
non interactive shell
you run scripts (myscripts.sh)
