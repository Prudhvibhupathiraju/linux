Program 
it is a static file stored in a disk
it contains instructions written by a developer

process
A process is a program in execution
it is active loaded into RAM
It has Process ID (PID), Memory, CPU time and State (running, sleeping, stopped)

CPU time
it is actual time the CPU spends executing the program

RAM(Random Access Memory) is the temporary working memory of a computer

RAM is stores running programs(processes) , data needed right now, kernel and system services file cache (to speed things up)

Kernel is the core of an operating system that manages the hardwar resources and allows software to interact with them

RAM temporarrily holds the data and instructions that are needed by CPU to perform operations

Memory usage shows how much RAM is occupied, while CPU usage shows how much processing power used at a given time

In Linux, unused RAM = wasted RAM., Linux uses free memory for Cache (recently used files) and Buffers (disk I/O optimization)
