Understanding the Folder Structure
Explanation of System Directories
Symbolic Links (Less Significant)
Directory 	Description
/sbin -> /usr/sbin 	System binaries for administrative commands (linked to /usr/sbin).
/bin -> /usr/bin 	Essential user binaries (linked to /usr/bin).
/lib -> /usr/lib 	Shared libraries and kernel modules (linked to /usr/lib).
Important System Directories
Directory 	Description
/boot 	Stores files needed for booting the system (not relevant in containers).
/usr 	Contains most user-installed applications and libraries.
/var 	Stores logs, caches, and temporary files that change frequently.
/etc 	Stores system configuration files.
User & Application-Specific Directories
Directory 	Description
/home 	Default location for user home directories.
/opt 	Used for installing optional third-party software.
/srv 	Holds data for services like web servers (rarely used in containers).
/root 	Home directory for the root user.
Temporary & Volatile Directories
Directory 	Description
/tmp 	Temporary files (cleared on reboot).
/run 	Holds runtime data for processes.
/proc 	Virtual filesystem for process and system information.
/sys 	Virtual filesystem for hardware and kernel information.
/dev 	Contains device files (e.g., /dev/null, /dev/sda).
Mount Points
Directory 	Description
/mnt 	Temporary mount point for external filesystems.
/media 	Mount point for removable media (USB, CDs).

/data 	Likely your mounted volume from Windows (C:/ubuntu-data).


/sbin is a system binary directory — it contains essential system administration executables (programs and commands) that are usually used by the root (superuser).

/lib is a system directory that contains shared libraries — these are files that programs and the operating system need to run.

/bin stands for “binary”, and it contains essential user command binaries — the basic programs needed for the system to boot, repair itself, and allow users to work. These are commands that both normal users and root can run.

/boot holds the bootloader and kernel files that your system needs to start up. Without this directory, Linux cannot boot.

File system in Linux

Directories are divided into 
binary directories, --> /bin, /sbin, /lib, /opt
configuration directories, --> /boot, /etc
Data directories,  --> /home  /root /srv /media /mnt /tmp
memory directories 
usr(unix system resources) 
var(variable directories)

/ is the top directory

/root is the home directory to the root user who have full administrative access 

/bin holds user binaries(executable) files basic commands like ls, cp, mv, rm

/sbin holds the binaries(executable) files that containing root privileges (commands used by the Super user like mount , shutdown)

/lib holds essential shared libraries and kernel modules required by commands in /bin and /sbin.

/opt holds optional application software packages. if we install 3rd party application packges like if we import packages to install

/boot holds the files that are required during system boot

/etc(Extension of conf)
Configuration files of the system are stored in /etc.

/home holds user's personal files

/srv holds server specific data that is accessed by user

/media acts as mount point for removable devices like cd rom, floppy and usb

/mnt is used to temporarily mount file systems manually. 

/tmp holds temporary data like cache. The data in /tmp is deleted when the system is rebooted.

/usr stores programs and files that do NOT change while the system is running.

It contains:

Programs (commands)

Libraries

Documentation

Examples:

/usr/bin → user commands

/usr/lib → libraries

/usr/share → shared data

👉 Think of /usr as installed software.

/var (Variable Directories)

/var stores files that change while the system is running.

It contains:

Log files

Cache files

Mail

Spool files

Examples:

/var/log → system logs

/var/cache → cache data

/var/spool → print/mail queues

👉 Think of /var as changing data.

Simple rule to remember

/usr → static (doesn’t change much)

/var → variable (changes often)

/proc

Shows information about running processes and system

/sys

Shows hardware and device information

/run

Stores temporary runtime data

/proc shows system information, /run stores temporary data used by running programs.

/dev stores special files that represent hardware devices so the system can communicate with them.

/ is the top level directory all files and directories exits under /
/bin contains essential command binaries used by all users 
/etc stores configuration files
/home -> users home directories
/var -> store frequently changing data ie /var/log
/usr -> User application and programs
/dev -> represents hardware devices as files
/tmp -> stores temperary files created by programs

/ - root directory ( top level directory it is a base of every thing )
/bin - binaries it contains basic commands that the system need to work properly ( it stores main commands you system need to start properly, run basic tasks and fix properly) 
/sbin - system binaries It contains important system and admin command to manage and control the system (root user commands) 
/etc - /etc folder contains configuration files ( Users and passwords, Network Configuration, Services(SSH, Apache), System startup, Software settings
/home - user home directories
/var - is a directory that contains variable data ( data that changes frequently) files that keep updating or growing (log files, application data, mail files, cache files, temporary files)
/usr - /usr stores program, application and system files used by the users ( main software storage area of linux ) 
/usr/bin - normal user commands 
/usr/sbin - Admin commands
/usr/lib - stores library files needed by the programs ( library file contain a common code that many programs use every program instead of having its own copy of code they share it from here) 
/usr/share contains shared non binary files like documentation manual pages etc
/usr/local - contains software installed manually not by using dnf,yum,apt
/opt -> third party software is stored in /opt
/boot is a directory that stores files needed to boot the files linux file system
/dev -> /dev stands for devices (It contains files that represent hardware devices in Linux) (in Linux every thing is treated as files) like hard disks
/proc - used to store system and process information it does not store files on disk, it is created in memory while the system is running
/tmp - /tmp stores temporary files( files that are needed for short time, files that can be deleted after use)
